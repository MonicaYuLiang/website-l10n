###Final Project

The final project is a way for you to showcase your skills learned in this class.
You can choose to do this project individually or in groups. Since our class is
very large. I'm making it optional to present on the final day. If you are exceptionally
proud of your project, did something you feel is unique/displays technical or creative
acumen, I encourage you to present.

Requirements:

1. Submitted on Github, in its own repo, with a project description in the README.md.
If there's any setup to do to view the project (i.e. if you need to build the app), 
include those instructions, system requirements here as well.

2. Each group member must submit as assignemnt on Moodle for grading purposes

3. Best practices must be followed re: indenetation, separating css, js into separate files etc.

4. Must have an international aspect

5. Must be the appropriate complexity for the number of group members you have

Examples of possible final projects:

* Internationalize and localize an open source ruby on rails app
* Create a static webpage and localize it into several languages
* Write a shell script to automate somthing tedious for localization purposes
* Create an integration with Github and Transifex
* Write a white paper detailing a good web app localization workflow
